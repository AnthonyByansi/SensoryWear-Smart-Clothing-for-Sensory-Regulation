# SensoryWear: Smart Clothing for Sensory Regulation

SensoryWear is a project aimed at creating smart clothing with integrated biofeedback sensors to help individuals with sensory processing difficulties or neurological disorders regulate their nervous system. The clothing uses sensors to detect skin temperature, heart rate, and breathing, and provides gentle vibrations to the user to help regulate their nervous system.

The goal of SensoryWear is to create a user-friendly and customizable solution for individuals who have difficulty processing sensory information. By providing real-time feedback, the smart clothing can help users regulate their nervous system and promote relaxation and calm.
