# SensoryWear: Smart Clothing for Sensory Regulation

SensoryWear is a project aimed at creating smart clothing with integrated biofeedback sensors to help individuals with sensory processing difficulties or neurological disorders regulate their nervous system. The clothing uses sensors to detect skin temperature, heart rate, and breathing, and provides gentle vibrations to the user to help regulate their nervous system.

The goal of SensoryWear is to create a user-friendly and customizable solution for individuals who have difficulty processing sensory information. By providing real-time feedback, the smart clothing can help users regulate their nervous system and promote relaxation and calm.


## Components

* Clothing (e.g., shirt, pants, socks) with integrated sensors
* Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
* Vibration motor
* Battery
* Wiring and connectors

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Clothing with integrated sensors (either purchased or created)
* Microcontroller (Arduino or Raspberry Pi)
* Vibration motor
* Battery
* Wiring and connectors
* Soldering iron and solder

## Installation

* Connect the sensors to the microcontroller using wiring and connectors.
* Connect the vibration motor to the microcontroller using * wiring and connectors.
* Upload the code to the microcontroller. The code can be found in the "Code" folder of this repository.
* Connect the battery to the microcontroller and vibration motor.
* Turn on the power and test the smart clothing.

## Code

The code for SensoryWear is written in Arduino and can be found in the "Code" folder of this repository. The code reads data from the sensors and processes it to determine the appropriate level of feedback to provide. The feedback is then sent to the vibration motor to provide gentle vibrations to the user.
